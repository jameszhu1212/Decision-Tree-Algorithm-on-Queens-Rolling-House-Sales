# Queens-Rolling-Sales-NY-From-January-2022-to-December-2022

In this project, I used a decision tree algorithm to classify the sale price of homes/apartments in Queens, New York from January 2022 to December 2022. 
The data was retrieved from the New York Department of Finance. I used different sets of features to classify the sale price and an accuracy score was 
computed for each feature set. 


P.S I uploaded the rollingsales_queens into my seaborn load_dataset folder in JupyterNotebook. Then, I imported with sns! From mac user :(.
